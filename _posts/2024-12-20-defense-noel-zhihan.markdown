We are proud to share that Noel Jeffrey Pinton and Zhihan Wang, successfully defended their theses on Friday, December 20, 2024.

Noel’s PhD: "Synergistic PET/CT Reconstruction using Deep Learning" focuses on enhancing PET/CT imaging through deep learning techniques.

Zhihan’s PhD: "Synergistic Multi-energy CT Reconstruction using Deep Learning" leverages similar approaches to improve multi-energy CT image quality and reconstruction.

Both projects represent significant contributions to the field of medical imaging and demonstrate the potential of deep learning to improve diagnostic tools.

We wish them all the best in their future careers !

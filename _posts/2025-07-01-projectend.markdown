We are pleased to share that the MultiRecon project has now concluded.

## Overview

MultiRecon developed machine-learning methods for multimodal medical imaging (PET/CT and PET/MRI). Our main objectives were:

- Improve image quality by reducing noise
- Combine complementary information from different modalities
- Lower radiation dose for patients
- Focus on unsupervised learning

## Highlights

1. **Algorithms and Models**  
   - Multi-channel generative models for joint PET/CT, PET/MRI and cpectral CT  
   - Inter-modal consistency loss for more reliable results

2. **Validation**  
   - Benchmarked on datasets from LaTIM, CREATIS, SHFJ and CHU Poitiers   
   - Achieved sginificant noise reduction in most tests

3. **Publications**  
   - 6 papers published in peer-reviewed international journals  
   - 4 preprints submitted to peer-reviewed international journals


4. **Software**  
   - Python packages for PET/CT and PET/MRI synergistic reconstruction

5. **Dissemination**  
   - Presentations at IEEE NSS MIC RTSD, IEEE ISBI and Eusipco
   - PhD defenses by Noel Jeffrey Pinton, Zhihan Wang and Valentin Gautier

## Next Steps

Ongoing efforts include:

- Integrating our models into clinical workflows
- Extending methods to other imaging modalities

    Alexandre Bousse is a Research Associate with the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) and member of the [LaTIM](https://latim.univ-brest.fr/). 
    He received a PhD in Signal and Image Processing in 2008, and the research habilitation (HDR) in 2019. He has been involved in 5 image reconstruction projects with University 
    College London, including 2 EPSRC grants, a FP7 grant, a GE Healthcare grant, and he co-supervised 7 PhD students. He co-authored over 20 publications in scientific journals, 
    including IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging and Physics in Medicine & Biology. His main contribution comprises
    model-based image reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms for PET/CT and PET/MRI imaging with motion
    compensation. With an applied mathematics background, he is at the interface between theoretical
    and transitional research.

   Claude Comtat is a Senior Scientist and Medical Physicist at [Biomaps](http://www.biomaps.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) and 
   [Service Hospitalier Frédéric Joliot (SHFJ)](https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/en/Pages/research_entities/SHFJ.aspx). After physics studies at the EPFL, Lausanne, he received a PhD in Physics in 1996 and the HDR in 2013. His current research interests are multimodal imaging, in
   particular PET/MR, image reconstruction, and PET simulation. He has been involved in two European
   (EUREKA and MSC ITN) and five national projects in image reconstruction. He is the author of more than 50 papers, most of them in PET imaging. He is involved since the beginning in the development
   of [CASToR](https://www.castor-project.org/)  and was involved in the   [OpenGATE collaboration](http://opengatecollaboration.org/)  during its early phase.

   Catherine Cheze-Le Rest is a consultant professor of Nuclear Medicine at the [CHU Poitiers](https://www.chu-poitiers.fr/). Since the last twenty years she has been developing multiple research activities within the field of quanti-
   tative PET/CT imaging and more specifically in the field of functional volume segmentation for PET
   imaging. She has published pioneering work in the field of multimodality medical image based radiomics for the prediction of response and survival in lung, esophageal and H&N cancers. In addition,
   she has worked in demonstrating the interest of radiogenomics and the quantitative assessment of
   intratumor activity distribution heterogeneity in clinical practice.
